# Task 3 – Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Internship Domain
Cyber Security

## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to understand basic networking concepts and analyze real-time network traffic using packet capturing tools. This task helps in learning how data flows across a network and how different protocols behave.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark (Primary Tool)

## Concepts Covered
- IP Address and MAC Address
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- TCP and UDP protocols
- TCP Three-Way Handshake
- HTTP vs HTTPS
- Packet Sniffing

## Methodology
1. Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. Selected the active network interface and started live packet capture.
3. Generated network traffic by browsing websites.
4. Applied protocol filters such as TCP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS.
5. Observed TCP three-way handshake packets (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
6. Analyzed DNS queries and responses.
7. Compared plain-text HTTP traffic with encrypted HTTPS traffic.
8. Saved and documented observations.

## Observations
- TCP establishes a reliable connection using a three-way handshake.
- DNS queries are visible in plain text.
- HTTP traffic exposes readable data.
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted using TLS, making it secure.

## Learning Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience with network traffic analysis. It improved understanding of how data packets travel across a netw
